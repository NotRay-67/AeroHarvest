# Palmyra Tree Fruit Harvesting System

This repository introduces a novel application of autonomous drone technology combined with advanced machine learning algorithms for optimizing the harvesting process of palmyra tree fruits. By integrating YOLOv8 object detection with a specialized cutting mechanism, the system efficiently identifies and removes ripe fruit clusters from the tree branches. 

## Features

- Utilizes YOLOv8 object detection for identifying ripe fruit clusters
- Implements a specialized cutting mechanism for efficient harvesting
- Reduces time and labor requirements in the harvesting process
- Field evaluations demonstrate notable improvements in harvesting efficiency
- Presents a scalable solution for enhancing productivity in palmyra plantations
- Contributes to the advancement of agricultural automation technologies

## Installation
